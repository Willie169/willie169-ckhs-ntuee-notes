## willie169-ckhs-ntuee-notes

This repository contains the notes taken by [**Weiyu Shen 沈威宇**](https://github.com/Willie169), also known as **Willie169** or **Willie Shen**.

If you have any issue, please inform me through the Issue of this repository.

The notes mainly focus on the content that I studied at [**Taipei Municipal Chien Kuo High School (CKHS) 臺北市立建國高級中學**](https://www.ck.tp.edu.tw) and [**National Taiwan University Department of Electrical Engineering (NTUEE) 國立臺灣大學電機工程學系**](https://web.ee.ntu.edu.tw) but may also contain other fields. The notes were taken in [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org) and compiled with [TeXLive](https://www.tug.org/texlive), in which my template [LaTeX-ToolKit](https://github.com/Willie169/LaTeX-ToolKit), my package [physics-patch](https://github.com/Willie169/physics-patch), and fonts [TeX Gyre](https://ctan.org/pkg/tex-gyre), [Noto CJK](https://github.com/notofonts/noto-cjk), and [XITS Math](https://github.com/aliftype/xits) were heavily used.

[**tw-gifted-k12-notes**](https://github.com/Willie169/tw-gifted-k12-notes) is the predecessor of this repository, which is no longer updated and mainly contains the notes I made during my time at CKHS.
