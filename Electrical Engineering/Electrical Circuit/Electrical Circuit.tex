\sssc{Electrical network}
An electrical network or simply network is an interconnection of electrical components or a model of such an interconnection, consisting of electrical elements.
\sssc{Electrical element}
Electrical elements or simply elements are conceptual abstractions representing idealized electrical components, such as resistors, capacitors, and inductors, used in the analysis of electrical networks and denoted with circuit symbols, also called electronic symbol, in circuit diagrams.
\sssc{Direct current (DC)}
A direct current is a current that is one-directional and with constant voltage and current over time.
\sssc{Alternating current (AC)}
An alternating current is a current that changes its voltage and current over time and with zero voltage and current in average over an infinite time interval.
\sssc{General current in frequency domain}
Given a general current with voltage $v(t)$ and current $i(t)$ over time since $t=0$, we can perform Laplace transforms,
\[V(s)=\mathcal{L}\{v(t)\}(s)=\int_0^{\infty}e^{-st}v(t)\dd{t},\]
\[I(s)=\mathcal{L}\{i(t)\}(s)=\int_0^{\infty}e^{-st}i(t)\dd{t},\]
to obtain its voltage $V(s)$ and current $I(s)$ as a function of frequency domain $s$.
\sssc{Resistance and resistor}
The resistance $R$ of an element is the voltage across it over the current through it under DC:
\[v(t)=Ri(t).\]
\[V(s)=RI(s).\]
An ideal resistor is a circuit element with a resistance and no capacitance or inductance.
\begin{center}
\begin{circuitikz}
\draw (0,0) to[R, l=Resistor] (3,0);
\draw (5,0) to[vR, l=Variable Resistor] (8,0);
\draw (10,0) to[thermistor, l=Thermistor] (13,0);

\draw (0,0) to[ldR, l=Light Dependent Resistor] (3,0);
\draw (5,0) to[varistor, l=Varistor] (8,0);
\end{circuitikz}
\end{center}
Power absorbed:
\[p(t)=\frac{\qty(v(t))^2}{R}=\qty(i(t))^2R.\]
\sssc{Capacitance and capacitor}
The capacitance $C$ of an element is the current through it divided by the derivative of the voltage across it with respect to time:
\[i(t)=C\dv{v(t)}{t}.\]
\[I(s)=CsV(s)-Cv(0^-).\]
An ideal capacitor is a circuit element with a capacitance and no resistance or inductance.
\begin{center}
\begin{circuitikz}
\draw (0,0) to[C, l=Capacitor] (3,0);
\end{circuitikz}
\end{center}
A capacitor voltage must not be allowed to jump instantaneously from one value to another.

Integral voltage-current relationship:
\[v(t)=\frac{1}{C}\int_{t_0}^ti(\tau)\dd{\tau}+v(t_0)=\frac{1}{C}\int_{-\infty}^ti(\tau)\dd{\tau}.\]
Power absorbed:
\[p(t)=Cv(t)\dv{v(t)}{t}.\]
Energy stored:
\[\int_{-\infty}^tp(t)\dd{t}=\frac{1}{2}C\qty(v(t))^2.\]
\sssc{Inductance and inductor}
The inductance $L$ of an element is the voltage across it divided by the derivative of the current through it with respect to time:
\[v(t)=L\dv{i(t)}{t}.\]
\[V(s)=LsI(s)-Li(0^-).\]
An ideal inductor is a circuit element with an inductance and no resistance or capacitance.
\begin{center}
\begin{circuitikz}
\draw (0,0) to[L, l=Inductor] (3,0);
\end{circuitikz}
\end{center}
An inductor current must not be allowed to jump instantaneously from one value to another.

Integral voltage-current relationship:
\[i(t)=\frac{1}{L}\int_{t_0}^tv(\tau)\dd{\tau}+i(t_0)=\frac{1}{L}\int_{-\infty}^tv(\tau)\dd{\tau}.\]
Power absorbed:
\[p(t)=Li(t)\dv{i(t)}{t}.\]
Energy stored:
\[\int_{-\infty}^tp(t)\dd{t}=\frac{1}{2}L\qty(i(t))^2.\]
\sssc{Reactance}
The (capacitive) reactance $X_C$ of a one-port network with capacitance $C$ is defined as:
\[X_C(s)=\frac{1}{sC}.\]
There is also a definition that uses the negation of the definition above, which is not used here.

The (inductive) reactance $X_L$ of a one-port network with inductance $L$ is defined as:
\[X_L(s)=sL.\]
The reactance $X$ of a one-port network is defined as:
\[X(s)=X_L(s)-X_C(s).\]
A one-port network is said to have net capacitive reactance if $X(s)<0$ and have net inductive reactance if $X(s)>0$.
\sssc{Impedance}
The impedance $Z$ of a one-port network is defined as a complex number with its resistance as real part and its reactance as imaginary part:
\[Z(s)=R+jX(s).\]
\[V(s)=Z(s)I(s).\]
Thus, the behaviors of resistors, capacitors, and inductors can all be presented with a complex function of frequency domain, impedance, with net capacitance existing and being propositional to reciprocal of reactance if reactance is negative, net inductance existing and being propositional to the reactance if reactance is positive, and no net capacitance or inductance existing if reactance is zero.
\sssc{Admittance}
The admittance $Y(s)$ of a one-port network is defined as the reciprocal of its impedance:
\[Y(s)=\frac{1}{Z(s)}.\]
\sssc{Conductance}
The conductance $G(s)$ of a circuit element is defined as the real part of its admittance.
\sssc{Susceptance}
The susceptance $B(s)$ of a circuit element is defined as the imaginary part of its admittance:
\[Y(s)=G(s)+jB(s).\]
\sssc{Active element}
An active element is an element capable of furnishing an average power greater than zero to some external network over an infinite time interval.
\sssc{Passive element}
A passive element is an element that is not an active element.
\sssc{Lumped-element model, lumped-parameter model, or lumped-component model}
A simplified and idealized representation of an electrical network that assumes all components are concentrated at a single point and their behavior can be described by idealized mathematical models, that is, the lumped-matter discipline:
\bit
\item The change of the magnetic flux in time through the surface surrounded by a loop is zero.
\item The change of the charge in time inside conductor is zero.
\item Signal timescales of interest are much larger than propagation delay of electromagnetic waves across the lumped element.
\eit
such that the system is a dynamic system whose state space is a finite dimension, called lumped-parameter system.

In contrast, distributed parameter systems have infinite-dimensional state space.

We will concentrate on lumped-parameter networks in this text.
\sssc{Time-invariant network}
Elements' properties and connections don't change over time. We will concentrate on time-invariant networks in this text.
\sssc{Circuit element}
A circuit element is a two terminal electrical network that can be completely characterized by its voltage-current relationship.

We label + and - on the two terminal repsectively and voltage $v$ between them to define the voltage $v$ of the element as the electric potential difference of + terminal relative to - terminal.

We label arrow and current $i$ on it to define the reference direction of the current $i$ of the element.

If the current arrow enters the + terminal, the element is said to follow the passive sign convention. Under this convention, the power absorbed by the element is
\[p(t)=v(t)i(t),\]
with negative power means delivering.
