\ssc{Introduction}
\sssc{Electrical network}
An electrical network is an interconnection of electrical components or a model of such an interconnection, consisting of electrical elements.
\sssc{Electrical element}
Electrical elements are conceptual abstractions representing idealized electrical components, such as resistors, capacitors, and inductors, used in the analysis of electrical networks and denoted with circuit symbols, also called electronic symbol, in circuit diagrams.
\sssc{Passive element and active element}
A passive element is an element that cannot generate power. An active element is an element that can generate power.
\sssc{Lumped-element model, lumped-parameter model, or lumped-component model}
A simplified and idealized representation of an electrical network that assumes all components are concentrated at a single point and their behavior can be described by idealized mathematical models, that is, the lumped-matter discipline:
\bit
\item The change of the magnetic flux in time through the surface surrounded by a loop is zero.
\item The change of the charge in time inside conductor is zero.
\item Signal timescales of interest are much larger than propagation delay of electromagnetic waves across the lumped element.
\eit
such that the system is a dynamic system whose state space is a finite dimension, called lumped-parameter system.

In contrast, distributed parameter systems have infinite-dimensional state space.

We will concentrate on lumped-parameter networks in this text.
\ssc{Circuit element}
A circuit element is a two terminal electrical network that can be completely characterized by its voltage-current relationship, that is, with time $t$, voltage $v(t)$, and current $i(t)$, for some given three variable function $f$,
\[f\qty(v(t),i(t),t)=0.\]

We label + and - on the two terminal repsectively and voltage $v(t)$ between them to define the voltage $v(t)$ of the element as the electric potential difference of + terminal relative to - terminal.

We label arrow and current $i(t)$ on it to define the reference direction of the current $i(t)$ of the element.

If the current arrow enters the + terminal, the element is said to follow the passive sign convention. Under this convention, the power absorbed by the element is
\[p(t)=v(t)i(t),\]
with negative power means delivering.
\sssc{Node}
A node is a point in a network where two or more elements are connected.
\sssc{Pole or terminal}
A pole or a terminal is a node that is available for connection to an external network.
\sssc{Path}
A path is any route through which current can flow from one node to another.
\sssc{Branch}
A branch is a single element or a group of elements in series that connects two nodes.
\sssc{Loop}
A loop is any closed path in a network where you can start at a node, traverse branches, and return to the starting node without retracing any branch.
\sssc{Mesh}
A mesh is a loop that contains no other loop inside it.
\sssc{Electrical circuit or closed circuit}
An electrical circuit is a network containing loops.
\sssc{Open circuit}
An open circuit is an electrical network that is not a circuit.
\sssc{Port}
A port is a pair of terminals through which current can enter or leave a network and satisfies the port condition: the current flowing into one pole from outside is equal to the current flowing out of the other pole to outside.

An $n$-port network is a network with $2n$ poles forming $n$ ports.
\sssc{Resistor}
An ideal resistor is a circuit element with a resistance and no capacitance or inductance.

\end{center}
\sssc{Sinusoidal alternating current}
The voltage and current of a sinusoidal AC
\[v(t)=v_m\cos(\omega t+\phi),\]
\[i(t)=i_m\cos(\omega t+\theta),\]
are represented in phasors $v_m\angle\phi$ and $i_m\angle\theta$, which can be treated as complex numbers $v_me^{i\phi}$ and $i_me^{i\theta}$.

When the context is clear, sinusoidal AC may be called simply AC.

A frequency range of sinusoidal AC is called bandwidth.

Here, all currents discussed are either sinusoidal AC or DC.
\sssc{Reactance}
Let the capacitance of a circuit element under alternating current at an angular frequency of $\omega$ be $C$. Then its capacitive reactance $X_C$ is defined as:
\[X_C=\frac{1}{\omega C}.\]
There is also a definition that is the opposite of the above definition, i.e., the capacitive reactance is negative, which is not used here.

Let the inductance of a circuit element under alternating current with an angular frequency of $\omega$ be $L$. Then its inductive reactance $X_L$ is defined as:
\[X_L=\omega L.\]
The reactance $X$ of a circuit element is defined as:
\[X=X_L-X_C.\]
A circuit element is said to have net capacitive reactance if $X<0$ and have net inductive reactance if $X>0$.
\sssc{Impedance}
The impedance $Z$ of a one-port network is defined as a complex number with its resistance as real part and its reactance as imaginary part:
\[Z=R+jX,\]
where $j=\sqrt{-1}$ is the imaginary unit (since $i$ is used by current).

For AC in phasor notation, we can write
\[v=Zi.\]
\sssc{Admittance}
The admittance $Y$ of a one-port network is defined as the reciprocal of its impedance:
\[Y=\frac{1}{Z}.\]
\sssc{Conductance}
The conductance $G$ of a circuit element is defined as the real part of its admittance, for circuit element under direct current, that is, the reciprocal of its resistance.
\sssc{Susceptance}
The susceptance $B$ of a circuit element is defined as the imaginary part of its admittance:
\[Y=G+jB.\]
\sssc{Phase shift by impedance}
A circuit element with resistance $R$ and reactance $X$ introduces a change $\arctan(\frac{X}{R})$ in phase angle difference of current relative to voltage to the output current relative to input current. For in-phase input AC, circuit element with $X>0$ makes output current lags voltage, and circuit element with $X<0$ makes output current leads voltage.
\sssc{Wire or lead}
Circuit elements in a network are connected with wires (aka leads), which are assumed to have zero impedance.
\begin{center}
\begin{circuitikz}
\draw (0,0) to[short, l=Wire] (3,0);
\draw (5,0) to[crossing, l=Wire Crossing] (8,0);
\end{circuitikz}
\end{center}
Adding a wire directly between two nodes is called adding a short circuit.
\sssc{Linear element and Ohm's law}
A linear element is a passive element whose resistance $R$, capacitance $C$, and inductance $L$ are assumed to be independent of voltage and current, that is, equivalent to a one-port network consists of ideal resistors, capacitors, and inductors, that is, the voltage-current relationship under sinusoidal AC is a complex (real for DC) equation $v(t)=Z\cdot i(t)$ ($v(t)=R\cdot i(t)$) with voltage $v(t)$, current $i(t)$, and impedance $Z$ (resistance $R$ for DC). The assumption for resistance is the Ohm's law.
\sssc{Souces}
Ideal sources are active elements assumed to have zero impedance.

\[I(t)=A_1e^{-\omega_0\zeta t}\cos\left(\omega_0\sqrt{1-\zeta^2}t\right)+A_2e^{-\omega_0\zeta t}\sin\left(\omega_0\sqrt{1-\zeta^2}t\right)\]
無阻尼響應（Undamped response）（$\zeta=0$即$R=0$）的$I(t)$通解為：
\[I(t)=A_1\cos\left(\omega_0t\right)+A_2\sin\left(\omega_0t\right)\]
\subsubsection{常電流並聯 RLC 與 LC 電路}
常電流並聯 RLC 電路：常電流$I$直流電源、電阻$R$、電感$L$、電容$C$並聯。

常電流並聯 LC 電路：常電流$I$直流電源、電感$L$、電容$C$並聯，即令 $\frac{1}{R}=0$。
\[\frac{1}{R}V(t)+C\dv{V(t)}{t}+\frac{1}{L}\int _{-\infty}^tV(\tau)\,\mathrm{d}\tau=I\]
\[\dv[2]{V(t)}{t}+\frac{1}{RC}\dv{V(t)}{t}+\frac{1}{LC}V(t)=0\]
定義奈培頻率（neper frequency）/衰減量（attenuation）$\alpha=\frac{1}{2RC}$與角共振頻率（angular resonance frequency）$\omega_0=\frac{1}{\sqrt{LC}}$。
\[\dv[2]{V(t)}{t}+2\alpha\dv{V(t)}{t}+\omega_0^{\phantom{0}2}V(t)=0\]
定義阻尼係數（damping factor）$\zeta$：
\[\zeta=\frac{\alpha}{\omega_0}=\frac{1}{2R}\sqrt{\frac{L}{C}}\]
特徵根：
\[s_1=-\omega_0\zeta+\omega_0\sqrt{\zeta^2-1}\]
\[s_2=-\omega_0\zeta-\omega_0\sqrt{\zeta^2-1}\]
過阻尼響應（Overdamped response）（$\zeta>1$）的$V(t)$通解為：
\[V(t)=A_1e^{-\omega_0\left(\zeta+\sqrt{\zeta^2-1}\right)t}+A_2e^{-\omega_0\left(\zeta-\sqrt{\zeta^2-1}\right)t}\]
臨界阻尼響應（Critically damped response）（$\zeta=1$）的$V(t)$通解為：
\[V(t)=A_1e^{-\omega_0\zeta t}+A_2e^{-\omega_0\zeta t}\]
欠阻尼響應（Underdamped response）（$0<\zeta<1$）的$V(t)$通解為：
\[V(t)=A_1e^{-\omega_0\zeta t}\cos\left(\omega_0\sqrt{1-\zeta^2}t\right)+A_2e^{-\omega_0\zeta t}\sin\left(\omega_0\sqrt{1-\zeta^2}t\right)\]
無阻尼響應（Undamped response）（$\zeta=0$即$\frac{1}{R}=0$）的$V(t)$通解為：
\[V(t)=A_1\cos\left(\omega_0t\right)+A_2\sin\left(\omega_0t\right)\]
