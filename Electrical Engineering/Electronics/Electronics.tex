\sssc{Signal}
A signal is a function that conveys information about a phenomenon. Signal processing is usually most conveniently performed by electronic systems, and voltage signals are studied here.
\sssc{Transducer}
A transducer is a device that convert a signal to a voltage signal.
\sssc{Signal source}
A signal source is typically represented in the Thévenin form, a voltage source in a series connection with a resistance, or the Norton form, a current source in a parallel connection with a resistance.
