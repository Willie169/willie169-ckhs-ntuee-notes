\ssc{Definitions}
\sssc{Support}
For a function $f\colon D_f\subseteq\bbR^n\to\bbR$ (or $\bbC$), the support of it, denoted as $\supp(f)$, is defined as
\[\supp(f)=\closure(\{x\in D_f\mid f(x)\neq 0\}).\]
If $\supp(f)$ is a compact set, $f$ is called of compact support. If $\supp(f)$ is a compact subset of $U$, $f$ is called of compact support on $U$. $C^k_c(U)$ for $k\in\bbN\cup\{\infty\}$ denotes the vector space of $C^k(U)$-functions with compact support on $U$. For any compact subset $K$ of $U$, $C^k(K;U)$ denotes the vector space of $C^k(U)$-functions with compact support on $K$.
\sssc{Test function}
A test function on $U$ is a function in $C^{\infty}_c(U)$. The space of test functions on $U$ is $C^{\infty}_c(U)$, also denoted as $\mathcal{D}(U)$.
\sssc{Set of compact subsets as directed set}
The set of compact subsets of $U$ form a directed set $\bbK$ with order by inclusion.
\sssc{Topology of $C^k(K;U)$ and $C^k(U)$}
For any subset $U$ of $\bbR^n$, for any $k\in\bbN\cup\{\infty\}$, for any $f\in C^k(U)$, for any integer $i$ such that $0\leq i\leq k$, for any nonempty compact subset $K$ of $U$, with the set $\mathcal{P}$ of all multi-indices $p$ such that $|p|\leq i$, define,
\[q_{i,K}(f)\coloneq\sup_{p\in\mathcal{P}}\qty(\sup_{x\in K}\abs{\partial^pf(x)}),\]
and define $q_{i,\varnothing}(f)=0$.

Define the topology of $C^k(K;U)$ as the topology generated by the family of seminorms $q_{i,K}$ for any integer $i$ such that $0\leq i\leq k$, thus $C^k(K;U)$ is a locally convex topological vector space.

Define the topology of $C^k(U)$ as the topology generated by the family of seminorms $q_{i,K}$ for any compact subset $K$ of $U$, for any integer $i$ such that $0\leq i\leq k$, thus $C^k(U)$ is a locally convex topological vector space.
\sssc{Canonical LF topology}
$C^k_c(U)$ is equipped with the canonical LF topology defined as the finest topology such that for any compact subset $K$ of $U$, the inclusion map from $C^k(K;U)$ to $C^k_c(U)$ is continuous.
\sssc{Distribution}
A distribution on $U$ is a continuous linear functional on $C^{\infty}_c(U)$. The space of distributions on $U$ is the strong dual space of $C^{\infty}_c(U)$, denoted as $\mathcal{D}'(U)$ and equipped with the strong dual topology.
