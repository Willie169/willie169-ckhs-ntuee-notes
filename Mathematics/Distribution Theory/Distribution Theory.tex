\sssc{Support}
For a function $f\colon D_f\subseteq\bbR_n\to\bbR$ (or $\bbC$), the support of it, denoted as $\supp(f)$, is defined as
\[\supp(f)=\closure(\{x\in D_f\mid f(x)\neq 0\}).\]
If $\supp(f)$ is a subset of a compact set, $f$ is called of compact support. If $\supp(f)$ is a subset of a compact subset of $U$, $f$ is called of compact support on $U$. $C^k_c(U)$ for $k\in\bbN\cup\{\infty\}$ is the vector space of $C^k(U)$ functions with $\supp(f)$ being a compact subset of $U$.
\sssc{Test function}
The space of test functions on $U$ is $C^{\infty}_c(U)$, also denoted as $\mathcal{D}(U)$.
\sssc{Topology}
For any subset $U$ of $\bbR^n$, suppose $k\in\bbN\cup\{\infty\}$, $K$ is an arbitrary compact subset of $U$, and $i$ is an integer such that $0\leq i\leq k$ and $p$ is a multi-index with norm $|p|\leq k$. For $K\neq\varnothing$ and $f\in C^k(U)$, define:
\[s_{p,K}(f)\coloneq\sup_{x\in K}\abs{\partial^pf(x)},\]
\[q_{i,K}(f)\coloneq\sup_{|p|\leq i}s_{p,K},\]
\[r_{i,K}(f)\coloneq\sup_{|p|\leq i\land x\in K}\abs{\partial^pf(x)},\]
\[t_{i,K}(f)\coloneq\sup_{x\in K}\qty(\sum_{|p|\leq i}\abs{\partial^pf(x)}),\]
and for $K=\varnothing$ define all of them as constant 0 map.
