\sssc{Support}
For a function $f\colon D_f\subseteq\bbR_n\to\bbR$ (or $\bbC$), the support of it, denoted as $\supp(f)$, is defined as
\[\supp(f)=\closure(\{x\in D_f\mid f(x)\neq 0\}).\]
If $\supp(f)$ is a subset of a compact set, $f$ is called of compact support. If $\supp(f)$ is a subset of a compact subset of $U$, $f$ is called of compact support on $U$. $C^k_c(U)$ for $k\in\bbN\cup\{\infty\}$ is the vector space of $C^k(U)$ functions with $\supp(f)$ being a compact subset of $U$.
\sssc{Test function}
The space of test functions on $U$ is $C^{\infty}_c(U)$, also denoted as $\mathcal{D}(U)$.
\sssc{Topology}
Suppose $k\in\bbN\cup\{\infty\}$, $K$ is an arbitrary compact subset of $U$, and $i$ is an integer such that $0\leq i\leq k$ and $p$ is a multi-index with length $|p|\leq k$. For $K\neq\varnothing$ and
