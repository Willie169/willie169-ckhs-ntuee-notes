\sct{Structure}
\ssc{Signature}
A signature $\sigma=(\mathcal{P},\mathcal{F})$ is a pair of indexed sets of non-logical symbols,
\bit
\item a set of sets of predicate symbols (also called relation symbols) $\mathcal{P}=\{P_n\mid n\in\bbN_0\}$ with $P_n$ being a possibly infinite set of predicate symbols of arity $n$,
\item a set of sets of function symbols $\mathcal{F}=\{F_n\mid n\in\bbN_0\}$ with $F_n$ being a possibly infinite set of function symbols of arity $n$, with any element of $F_0$ called a constant.
\eit
\ssc{Structure}
(In model theory), a structure $\mathcal{A}$, also called model, can be defined with a triple $(A,\sigma,I)$ of a domain, also called universe, carrier, underlying set, domain of discourse, or universe of discourse, $A$, denoted as $|\mathcal{A}|$ or simply $\mathcal{A}$, a signature $\sigma$, and an interpretation function $I$ that, for all $n\in\bbN_0$, maps each $f\in F_n$ to a function $I(f)$ from $A^n$ to $A$, called interpretation of $f$ and often denoted as $f$, and each $p\in P_n$ to a subset $I(p)$ of $A^n$, called interpretation of $f$ and often denoted as $p$.
\ssc{Substructure}
A structure $\mathcal{B}=(B,\sigma_B,I_B)$ is a substructure of a structure $\mathcal{A}=(A,\sigma_A,I_A)$, denoted as $\mathcal{B}\subseteq\mathcal{A}$, iff
\bit
\item $B\subseteq A$,
\item $\sigma_B=\sigma_A$,
\item for every $n\in\bbN_0$, for every function symbol $f\in F_n$, $I_B(f)=I_A(f)\upharpoonright B^n$, and
\item for every $n\in\bbN_0$, for every relation symbol $p\in P_n$, $I_B(p)=I_A(p)\cap B^n$.
\eit
\ssc{Closed subset}
For a structure $\mathcal{A}=(A,\sigma,I)$, a subset $B\subseteq A$ is called closed iff, for all $n\in\bbN_0$, for any $f\in F_n$ and $b\in B^n$, $I(f)(b)\in B$.

For any subset $B$ of $A$, there exists a smallest closed subset that is a superset of $B$, called the hull of $B$ or the closed subset generated by $B$, denoted as $\langle B\rangle_\mathcal{A}$.
\ssc{Homomorphism}
A ($\sigma-$)homomorphism from a structure $\mathcal{A}=(A,\sigma,I_A)$ to a structure $\mathcal{B}=(B,\sigma,I_B)$ is a map $h\colon A\to B$ such that,
\bit
\item for all $n\in\bbN_0$, for any $f\in F_n$ and $a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n\in A^n$,
\[h(I_A(f)(a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n))=I_B(f)(h(a_1),h(a_2),\ldots,h(a_n)),\]
\item for all $n\in\bbN_0$, for any $p\in P_n$ and $a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n\in A^n$,
\[(a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n)\in I_A(p)\implies(h(a_1),h(a_2),\ldots,h(a_n))\in I_B(p).\]
\eit
\ssc{Strong homomorphism}
A strong ($\sigma-$)homomorphism from a structure $\mathcal{A}=(A,\sigma,I_A)$ to a structure $\mathcal{B}=(B,\sigma,I_B$ is a map $h\colon A\to B$ such that,
\bit
\item for all $n\in\bbN_0$, for any $f\in F_n$ and $a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n\in A^n$,
\[h(I_A(f)(a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n))=I_B(f)(h(a_1),h(a_2),\ldots,h(a_n)),\]
\item for all $n\in\bbN_0$, for any $p\in P_n$ and $a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n\in A^n$,
\[(a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n)\in I_A(p)\iff(h(a_1),h(a_2),\ldots,h(a_n))\in I_B(p).\]
\eit
\ssc{Embedding}
A ($\sigma-$)embedding from a structure $\mathcal{A}=(A,\sigma,I_A)$ to a structure $\mathcal{B}=(B,\sigma,I_B$ is a strong homomorphisms $h$ from $\mathcal{A}$ to $\mathcal{B}$ that is injective.
\sct{Propositional logic (PL), statement logic, sentential logic, propositional calculus, statement calculus, sentential calculus, or zeroth-order logic}
\ssc{Syntax}
Given
\bit
\item a set of symbols $\mathcal{O}=\{\uparrow\}$ (here $\uparrow$ denotes NAND and is binary, while $\mathcal{O}$ can be any functionally complete set of logical operators in Boolean algebra with related definitions changed to the equivalent form for that $\mathcal{O}$), called connectives, logical connectives, logical operators, truth-functional connectives, truth-functors, or propositional connectives, and
\item a set of symbols $\mathcal{P}$ with $\mathcal{P}\cap\mathcal{O}=\nothing$ and $\mathcal{O}\cup\mathcal{P}$ be the alphabet of $\mathcal{L}$, called atomic propositions, atomic formulas, atomic sentences, atoms, proposition letters, sentence letters, propositional variables, or variables,
\eit
the formal language $\mathcal{L}$ of propositional logic is defined by:
\bit
\item $\mathcal{P}\subseteq\mathcal{L}$,
\item $(P\uparrow Q)\in\mathcal{L}$ if $P,Q\in\mathcal{L}$, and
\item nothing else is in $\mathcal{L}$.
\eit
Any $w\in\mathcal{L}$ is called a well-formed formula (WFF or wff) or simply formula.
\ssc{Semantics}
\sssc{Interpretation}
For a given set of atomic propositions $\mathcal{P}$, the interpretation (or valuation) function $\mathcal{I}$ maps every formula in $\mathcal{P}$ to a semantic value in $\{1,0\}$ (with 1 meaning true and 0 meaning false), to each $P\in\mathcal{P}$, denoted as
\[\mathcal{I}(P)=B.\]

For a given propositional logic with formal language $\mathcal{L}$, the interpretation function $\mathscr{I}$ over $\mathcal{L}$ is recursively defined as
\bit
\item for any $P\in\mathcal{P}$, $\mathscr{I}(P)=\mathcal{I}(P)$,
\item for any $P,Q\in\mathcal{L}$, $\mathscr{I}(P\uparrow Q)=\mathscr{I}(P)\uparrow\mathscr{I}(Q)$.
\eit
For any $P\in\mathcal{L}$, we write $\mathcal{I}\vDash P$ if $\mathscr{I}(P)=1$ and $\mathcal{I}\nvDash P$ if $\mathscr{I}(P)=0$.
\sssc{Classification of formulas}
A formula $P$ is called (logically) valid or a tautology iff for any interpretation function $\mathcal{I}$, $\mathcal{I}\vDash P$.

A formula $P$ is called (logically) invalid or a contradiction iff for any interpretation function $\mathcal{I}$, $\mathcal{I}\nvDash P$.

A formula $P$ is called contingent iff it is neither a tautology nor a contradiction.

A formula $P$ is called satisfiable iff it is not a contradiction.
\sct{First-order logic (FOL), predicate logic, predicate calculus, or quantificational logic}
\ssc{Syntax}
Given logic symbols,
\bit
\item (either one of) the quantifier symbols $\forall$ for universal quantification and $\exists$ for existential quantification,
\item a set of logical connectives same as propositional logic $\mathcal{O}=\{\uparrow,\implies\}$ with $\uparrow$ denoting NAND and $\implies$ denoting implication for simplicity,
\item a set of punctuation symbols $\mathcal{N}$ containing $(,),,$ and maybe other symbols, which do not carry meaning themselves but to help parse and read the language,
\item an infinite set of variables $\mathcal{V}$,
\item an equality symbol $=$ for first-order logic with equality,
\eit
and a signature $\sigma=(\mathcal{P},\mathcal{F})$ with the equality symbol $=\in P_2$ for first-order logic with equality, the set of terms $\mathcal{T}$ is defined by:
\bit
\item $\mathcal{V}\subseteq\mathcal{T}$,
\item $F_0\im\mathcal{T}$, and
\item for all $n\in\bbN$, for all $t\in\mathcal{T}^n$, for all $f\in F_n$, $f(t)\in\mathcal{T}$,
\eit
the set of atomic formulas $\mathcal{C}$ is defined as
\[\mathcal{C}=\bigcup_{n\in\bbN}\{p(t)\mid t\in\mathcal{T}^n\land p\in P_n\},\]
and the formal language $\mathcal{L}$ of first-order logic is defined by:
\bit
\item $\mathcal{C}\subseteq\mathcal{L}$
\item $(P\uparrow Q)\in\mathcal{L}$ if $P,Q\in\mathcal{L}$, and
\item $\forall xP$ and $\exists xP$ are in $\mathcal{L}$ if $P\in\mathcal{L}$ and $x\in\mathcal{V}$,
\item nothing else is in $\mathcal{L}$.
\eit
Any $w\in\mathcal{L}$ is called a well-formed formula (WFF or wff) or simply formula.
\ssc{Free and bounded variables}
A variable in a formula is either free or bounded, which are defined as follows:
\bit
\item A variable in an atomic formula is free.
\item A variable is free in $P\uparrow Q$ if it is free in formula $P$ or $Q$.
\item A variable $x$ is free in $\forall yP$ (and/or $\exists yP$) if $x$ is not the same symbol as $y$ and $x$ is free in formula $P$.
\item No other variable in a formula is free.
\eit
A formula with no free variable is called a sentence or a closed formula.
\ssc{Semantics}
\sssc{Interpretation}
We define the semantics of a formula $P$ with a structure $\mathcal{A}=(A,\sigma,I)$ of the same signature as the first-order logic with the constraint for first-order logic with equality that
\[I(=)=\{(a,a)\mid a\in A\}\]
and a variable assignment function $s$ from the free variables in $P$ to $A$ as either $\mathcal{A},s\vDash P$, read $P$ is true in $\mathcal{A}$ under assignment $s$, or $\mathcal{A},s\nvDash P$, read $P$ is false in $\mathcal{A}$ under assignment $s$, with,
\bit
\item For any term $t$, $[t]$ or $[t]_{\mathcal{A},s}$ denotes $t$ with any function symbols $f$ replaced with $I(f)$ and any variable $x$ replaced with $s(x)$,
\item For any atomic formula $p(t_1,t_2,\ldots,t_n)$ for some predicate symbol $p\in P_n$, $\mathcal{A},s\vDash p(t)$ iff $[t_1],[t_2],\ldots,[t_n]\in I(p)$, and
\item T-schema or truth schema: with $\mathscr{I}$ mapping formula $P$ to 1 if $\mathcal{A},s\vDash P$ and to 0 if $\mathcal{A},s\nvDash P$,
\bit
\item For any $P,Q\in\mathcal{L}$, $\mathscr{I}(P\uparrow Q)=\mathscr{I}(P)\uparrow\mathscr{I}(Q)$.
\item For any $P,Q\in\mathcal{L}$, $\mathscr{I}(P\implies Q)=\mathscr{I}(Q)\uparrow\mathscr{I}(Q)\uparrow\mathscr{I}(P)$.
\item $\mathcal{A},s\vDash\forall xP$ iff $\forall a\in A$, replacing $x$ with $a$ makes $\mathcal{A},s\vDash P$, that is, $\forall xP=\bigwedge_{a\in A}P[x\mapsto a]$,
\item $\mathcal{A},s\vDash\exists xP$ iff $\exists a\in A$, replacing $x$ with $a$ makes $\mathcal{A},s\vDash P$, that is, $\exists xP=\bigvee_{a\in A}P[x\mapsto a]$.
\eit
For sentences, $s$ can be skipped since there is no free variable and $s$ is irrelevant. For a sentence $P$, $\mathcal{A}\vDash P$ is called $\mathcal{A}$ satisfies $P$.
\sssc{Logical consequence}
Given two sentences $S,T$, $S\vDash T$ means for any structure $\mathcal{A}$, if $\mathcal{A}\vDash S$, then $\mathcal{A}\vDash T$, called $T$ is a logical consequence of $S$.
\sssc{Classification of sentences}
A sentence $P$ is called (logically) valid or a tautology iff for any interpretation structure $\mathcal{A}$, $\mathcal{A}\vDash P$.

A sentence $P$ is called (logically) invalid or a contradiction iff for any interpretation structure $\mathcal{A}$, $\mathcal{A}\nvDash P$.

A sentence $P$ is called contingent iff it is neither a tautology nor a contradiction.

A sentence is satisfiable iff it is not a contradiction.
\sct{Deductive system, proof system, formal system, or formal proof system}
\ssc{Deductive system, proof system, formal system, or formal proof system}
A deductive system of a formal language $\mathcal{L}$ consists of
\bit
\item axioms: formulas in $\mathcal{L}$ that are assumed to be derived,
\item axiom schemas: expressions with schema variables that any expression obtained by replacing schema variables with arbitrary formulas in $\mathcavl{L}$ is assumed to be derived, and
\item rules of inference (Hilbert style): expression in the form $\frac{P_1,P_2,\ldots,P_n}{Q}$ for $P_1,P_2,\ldots,P_n,Q\in\mathcal{L}$ meaning that $Q$ is derived if $P_1,P_2,\ldots,P_n$ are all derived. Other styles exist and have the same expressive power as Hilbert style for propositional logic and predicate logic.
\eit
For every $P\in\mathcal{L}$, if $P$ is derived, we write $\vdash P$.
\ssc{Soundness}
A deductive system or proof system is sound if every formula that can be derived from the system is a tautology.
\ssc{Semantical completeness}
A deductive system or proof system is semantically complete if every tautology can be derived from the system.
