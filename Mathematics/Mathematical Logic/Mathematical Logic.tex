\sssc{Deductive system, proof system, formal system, formal proof system, proof calculus, or deductive calculus}
A deductive system, proof system, formal system, or formal proof system $\Gamma$ over a formal language $\mathcal{L}$ consists of axioms and rules of inference, where:
\bit
\item An axiom is a formula in $\mathcal{L}$ assumed to be derived in $\Gamma$.
\item An axiom schema is an expression with schema variables, each designated with a type of symbols in $\mathcal{L}$, that the expression obtained by replacing each schema variable with an arbitrary symbol of its type, called an application of the axiom schema, is assumed to be an axiom.
\item A rule of inference in Hilbert style is in the form $\frac{P_1,P_2,\ldots,P_n}{Q}$ where $P_1,P_2,\ldots,P_n,Q$ are expressions sharing the same set of metaformulas such that any expressions obtained by replacing each metaformula with an arbitrary formula in $\mathcal{L}$ are formulas in $\mathcal{L}$ and the expressions obtained by such replacement of $P_1,P_2,\ldots,P_n$ are assumed to derive the expression obtained by such replacement of $Q$, in which $P_1,P_2,\ldots,P_n$ and their replacements are called preimises and $Q$ and their replacements called conclusion. Other styles exist and have the same expressive power as Hilbert style for propositional logic and predicate logic.

\sssc{(Formal) derivation or proof}
Given proof system $\Gamma$ over language $\mathcal{L}$ and formulas $S_1,S_2,\ldots S_n,T\in\mathcal{L}$, a (formal) derivation or proof from $S_1,S_2,\ldots S_n$ to $T$ is a sequence of formulas $\langle F_i\rangle_{i=1}^m$ such that each $F_i$ is either
\bit
\item an axiom of $\Gamma$,
\item an element of $\{S_1,S_2,\ldots S_n\}$, or
\item can be derived from some of the earlier formulas in the sequence using a rule of inference,
\eit
and that $F_m=T$.

$S_1,S_2,\ldots S_n$ are called premises, $T$ is called conclusion, and this process is called argumentation.

That there exists a derivation from $S_1,S_2,\ldots S_n$ to $T$ is denoted as $S_1,S_2,\ldots S_n\vdash T$ and called $S_1,S_2,\ldots S_n$ derive or prove $T$.

Thus, for any axiom $\alpha$, $\vdash\alpha$.

Any formula $\alpha$ such that $\vdash\alpha$ is called derived or a theorem and is also denoted as $\Gamma\vdash\alpha$.
\sssc{Finitarity}
A rule of inference is finitary iff its premises are finite.

The rules of inference and sequences in formal proofs are required to be finite for finitary deductive systems.
\sssc{Soundness}
A deductive system is sound if every formula that can be derived from the system is a tautology in the language.
\sssc{Syntactic consequence}
For formulas $S_1,S_2,\ldots S_n,T$ in a language $\mathcal{L}$, $T$ is a syntactic consequence of $S_1,S_2,\ldots S_n$, denoted as $S_1,S_2,\ldots S_n\vdash T$, iff there exists a sound proof system over $\mathcal{L}$ in which $S_1,S_2,\ldots S_n\vdash T$.
\sssc{Independent formula}
A formula $P$ such that neither $\vdash P$ nor $\vdash\neg P$.
\sssc{(Syntactical) completeness}
A deductive system is (syntactically) complete if for every formula in the language, either it or its negation can be derived from the system.
\sssc{Semantical completeness}
A deductive system is semantically complete if every tautology in the language can be derived from the system.
\sssc{Interpretability}
If a deductive system $S$ over language $L$ and a deductive system $T$ over language $M$ are such that there exists a function $H\colon L\to M$ such that $S\vdash l\implies T\vdash H(l)$, then we say $T$ inteprets $S$, $S$ is weaker than $T$, or $T$ is stronger than $S$.
\sssc{Computably enumerable (c.e.), recursively enumerable (r.e.), semidecidable, partially decidable, listable, provable or Turing-recognizable deductive system}
A deductive system is computably enumerable (c.e.), recursively enumerable (r.e.), semidecidable, partially decidable, listable, provable or Turing-recognizable iff the set of all axioms of it is computably enumerable.

If a deductive system is computably enumerable and its rules of inferences are finitary, it is finitary.
\ssc{Model Theory}
\sssc{Signature}
A signature $\sigma=(\mathcal{P},\mathcal{F})$ is a pair of indexed sets,
\bit
\item a set of sets of predicate symbols (also called relation symbols) $\mathcal{P}=\{P_n\mid n\in\bbN_0\}$ with $P_n$ being a possibly infinite set of predicate symbols of arity $n$,
\item a set of sets of function symbols $\mathcal{F}=\{F_n\mid n\in\bbN_0\}$ with $F_n$ being a possibly infinite set of function symbols of arity $n$, with any element of $F_0$ called a constant.
\eit
\sssc{(Logical or model-theoric) structure}
A (logical or model-theoric) structure can be defined with a triple $(A,\sigma,I)$ of a set called domain, universe, carrier (set), underlying set, domain of discourse, or universe of discourse, $A$, denoted as $|\mathcal{A}|$ or simply $\mathcal{A}$, a signature $\sigma$, and an interpretation function $I$ that, maps for all $n\in\bbN_0$, maps each $f\in F_n$ to an $n$-ary operation $I(f)$ on $A$, called interpretation of $f$ and often denoted as $f$, and for all $n\in\bbN_0$, maps each $p\in P_n$ to a subset $I(p)$ of $A^n$, called interpretation of $p$ and often denoted as $p$, in which $A^0=\{\varnothing\}$.

A structure with signature $\sigma$ is called a $\sigma$-structure. A structure with signature $\sigma$ of a language $L$ is called a $L$-structure.
\sssc{Substructure}
A structure $\mathcal{B}=(B,\sigma_B,I_B)$ is a substructure of a structure $\mathcal{A}=(A,\sigma_A,I_A)$, that is, $\mathcal{A}$ is an extension of $\mathcal{B}$, denoted as $\mathcal{B}\subseteq\mathcal{A}$, iff
\bit
\item $B\subseteq A$,
\item $\sigma_B=\sigma_A$,
\item for every $n\in\bbN_0$, for every function symbol $f\in F_n$, $I_B(f)=I_A(f)\upharpoonright B^n$, and
\item for every $n\in\bbN_0$, for every relation symbol $p\in P_n$, $I_B(p)=I_A(p)\cap B^n$.
\eit
\sssc{Elementary substructure}
A structure $\mathcal{B}=(B,\sigma_B,I_B)$ is an elementary substructure of a structure $\mathcal{A}=(A,\sigma_A,I_A)$, that is, $\mathcal{A}$ is an elementary extension of $\mathcal{B}$, denoted as $\mathcal{B}\prec\mathcal{A}$, iff, with the language of $\sigma_B$ denoted as $\mathcal{L}$,
\bit
\item $\mathcal{B}\subseteq\mathcal{A}$,
\item for every $n$-ary formula $\varphi\in\mathcal{L}$, for every $a\in B^n$, $\mathcal{B}\vdash\varphi[a]\iff\mathcal{A}\vdash\varphi[b]$.
\eit
\sssc{Closed subset}
For a structure $\mathcal{A}=(A,\sigma,I)$, a subset $B\subseteq A$ is called closed iff, for all $n\in\bbN_0$, for any $f\in F_n$ and $b\in B^n$, $I(f)(b)\in B$.

For any subset $B$ of $A$, there exists a smallest closed subset that is a superset of $B$, called the hull of $B$ or the closed subset derived by $B$, denoted as $\langle B\rangle_\mathcal{A}$.
\sssc{Cardinality}
The cardinality of a structure is defined as the cardinality of its domain.
\sssc{Homomorphism}
A ($\sigma-$)homomorphism from a structure $\mathcal{A}=(A,\sigma,I_A)$ to a structure $\mathcal{B}=(B,\sigma,I_B)$ is a map $h\colon A\to B$ such that,
\bit
\item for all $n\in\bbN_0$, for any $f\in F_n$ and $a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n\in A^n$,
\[h(I_A(f)(a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n))=I_B(f)(h(a_1),h(a_2),\ldots,h(a_n)),\]
\item for all $n\in\bbN_0$, for any $p\in P_n$ and $a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n\in A^n$,
\[(a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n)\in I_A(p)\implies(h(a_1),h(a_2),\ldots,h(a_n))\in I_B(p).\]
\eit
For any $a\in A^n$ with $a=(a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n)$, $(h(a_1),h(a_2),\ldots,h(a_n))$ is denoted as $h(a)$.
\sssc{Strong homomorphism}
A strong ($\sigma-$)homomorphism from a structure $\mathcal{A}=(A,\sigma,I_A)$ to a structure $\mathcal{B}=(B,\sigma,I_B$ is a map $h\colon A\to B$ such that,
\bit
\item for all $n\in\bbN_0$, for any $f\in F_n$ and $a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n\in A^n$,
\[h(I_A(f)(a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n))=I_B(f)(h(a_1),h(a_2),\ldots,h(a_n)),\]
\item for all $n\in\bbN_0$, for any $p\in P_n$ and $a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n\in A^n$,
\[(a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n)\in I_A(p)\iff(h(a_1),h(a_2),\ldots,h(a_n))\in I_B(p).\]
\eit
\sssc{Embedding}
A ($\sigma-$)embedding from a structure $\mathcal{A}=(A,\sigma,I_A)$ to a structure $\mathcal{B}=(B,\sigma,I_B$ is a strong homomorphisms $h$ from $\mathcal{A}$ to $\mathcal{B}$ that is injective.
\sssc{Isomorphism}

\sssc{Isomorphism-invariance}
An $n$-free variable formula $\varphi$ is isomorphism-invariant between two models $\mathcal{M},\mathcal{N}$ with domains $M,N$ iff for every isomorphism $h$ between $\mathcal{M},\mathcal{N}$, for any $a\in M^n$:
\[\mathcal{M}\vdash\varphi[a]\iff\mathcal{N}\vdash\varphi[h(a)].\]
\sssc{Definability}
Let $L$ be a first-order language, $\mathcal{M}$ be a $L$-structure with domain $M$, $X$ be a fixed subset of $M$, and $m$ be a positive integer.
\bit
\item A set $A\subseteq M^m$ is definable in $\mathcal{M}$ with parameters from $X$ iff there exists a formula $\varphi$ of $m+n$ free variables and $b_1,b_2,\ldots,b_n\in X$ such that $\forall a_1\in M\forall a_2\in M\ldots\forall a_m\in M$, $(a_1,a_2\ldots,a_m)\in A$ iff $\mathcal{M}\vDash\varphi[a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_m,b_1,b_2,\ldots,b_n]$, and $\varphi[a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_m,b_1,b_2,\ldots,b_n]$ with parameters $b_1,b_2,\ldots,b_n$ is called defining formula.
\item A set is definable in $\mathcal{M}$ without parameter iff it is definable in $\mathcal{M}$ with parameters from $\varnothing$.
\item A function is definable in $\mathcal{M}$ (with some parameters) iff its graph is definable in $\mathcal{M}$ (with those parameters).
\item An element $a\in M^m$ is definable in $\mathcal{M}$ (with some parameters) iff $\{a\}$ is definable in $\mathcal{M}$ (with those parameters).

\ssc{Propositional logic (PL), statement logic, sentential logic, propositional calculus, statement calculus, sentential calculus, or zeroth-order logic}
\sssc{Syntax}
Given
\bit
\item a set of connectives, logical connectives, logical operators, truth-functional connectives, truth-functors, or propositional connectives $\mathcal{O}=\{\neg,\land,\lor\}$ with unary negation $\neg$, binary conjunction $\land$, and binary disjunction $\lor$, (or any functionally complete set of logical operators in Boolean algebra with related definitions changed accordingly), and
\item a set of atomic propositions, atomic formulas, atomic sentences, atoms, proposition letters, sentence letters, propositional variables, or variables $\mathcal{P}$ with $\mathcal{P}\cap\mathcal{O}=\nothing$ and $\mathcal{O}\cup\mathcal{P}$ be the alphabet of $\mathcal{L}$,
\eit
the formal language $\mathcal{L}$ of propositional logic is defined by:
\bit
\item $\mathcal{P}\subseteq\mathcal{L}$,
\item $\neg P\in\mathcal{L}$ if $P\in\mathcal{L}$,
\item $(P\land Q)\in\mathcal{L}$ if $P,Q\in\mathcal{L}$,
\item $(P\lor Q)\in\mathcal{L}$ if $P,Q\in\mathcal{L}$, and
\item nothing else is in $\mathcal{L}$.
\eit
Any $w\in\mathcal{L}$ is called a well-formed formula (WFF or wff), or simply formula.
\sssc{Semantics}
For a given propositional logic, its interpretation (or valuation) is defined as an interpretation (or valuation) function of its set of atomic propositions.

For a given set of atomic propositions $\mathcal{P}$, an interpretation (or valuation) function $\mathcal{I}$ maps every formula in $\mathcal{P}$ to a semantic value in $\{1,0\}$ (with 1 meaning true and 0 meaning false), denoted, for each $P\in\mathcal{P}$, as
\[\mathcal{I}(P)=B.\]

For a given propositional logic with formal language $\mathcal{L}$ and interpretation $\mathcal{I}$, the interpretation function $\mathscr{I}$ over $\mathcal{L}$ is recursively defined as
\bit
\item for any $P\in\mathcal{P}$, $\mathscr{I}(P)=\mathcal{I}(P)$,
\item for any $P\in\mathcal{L}$, $\mathscr{I}(\neg P)=\neg\mathscr{I}(P)$,
\item for any $P,Q\in\mathcal{L}$, $\mathscr{I}(P\land Q)=\mathscr{I}(P)\land\mathscr{I}(Q)$, and
\item for any $P,Q\in\mathcal{L}$, $\mathscr{I}(P\lor Q)=\mathscr{I}(P)\lor\mathscr{I}(Q)$.
\eit
For any $P\in\mathcal{L}$, we write $\mathcal{I}\vDash P$ if $\mathscr{I}(P)=1$ and $\mathcal{I}\nvDash P$ if $\mathscr{I}(P)=0$.

Alternatively, with structure, as expressed in the language of first-order logic, we can define each atomic formula in propositional logic as a nullary predicate symbol, that there is no function symbol, and that the interpretation structure maps each nullary predicate symbol to a subset of $\{\varnothing\}$, that is, either $\{\varnothing\}$ or $\varnothing$, and with $\varnothing\in\{\varnothing\}$ and $\varnothing\notin\varnothing$, an atomic formula mapped to $\{\varnothing\}$ is true and an atomic formula mapped to $\varnothing$ is false.
\sssc{Semantic consequence}
Given formulas $S_1,S_2,\ldots S_n,T$, $S_1,S_2,\ldots S_n\vDash T$, called that $T$ is a semantic consequence of $S_1,S_2,\ldots S_n$, means that for any interpretation function $\mathcal{I}$, if $\mathcal{I}\vDash S_1,\mathcal{I}\vDash S_2,\ldots,\mathcal{I}\vDash S_n$, then $\mathcal{I}\vDash T$.
\sssc{Equivalence of syntactic and semantic consequences}
For any formulas $S_1,S_2,\ldots S_n,T$,
\[S_1,S_2,\ldots S_n\vdash T\iff S_1,S_2,\ldots S_n\vDash T.\]
Thus syntactic and semantic consequences are called (logical) consequences.
\sssc{Classification of formulas}
A formula $P$ is called (logically) valid or a tautology, denoted as $\top$, iff for any interpretation function $\mathcal{I}$, $\mathcal{I}\vDash P$.

A formula $P$ is called (logically) invalid or a contradiction, denoted as $\bot$, iff for any interpretation function $\mathcal{I}$, $\mathcal{I}\nvDash P$.

A formula $P$ is called contingent iff it is neither a tautology nor a contradiction.

A formula $P$ is called satisfiable iff it is not a contradiction.
\sssc{Typical rules of inference}
For all equations that hold in Boolean algebra, with each Boolean variable replaced with a metaformula, LHS as numerator and RHS as denominator.
\ssc{First-order logic (FOL), predicate logic, predicate calculus, or quantificational logic}
Proportional logic and predicate logic are collectively called classical logic.
\sssc{Syntax}
Given logic symbols,
\bit
\item (either one of) the quantifier symbols $\forall$ for universal quantification and $\exists$ for existential quantification,
\item a set of logical connectives $\mathcal{O}=\{\neg,\land,\lor,\implies\}$ with unary negation $\neg$, binary conjunction $\land$, binary disjunction $\lor$, and binary material implication $\implies$, (or any functionally complete set of logical operators in Boolean algebra with related definitions changed accordingly),
\item a set of punctuation symbols $\mathcal{N}$ containing $(,),,$ and maybe other symbols, which do not carry meaning themselves but to help parse and read the language,
\item an infinite set of variables $\mathcal{V}$,
\item an equality symbol $=$ for first-order logic with equality,
\eit
and a signature $\sigma=(\mathcal{P},\mathcal{F})$ with the equality symbol $=\in P_2$ for first-order logic with equality, the set of terms $\mathcal{T}$ is defined by:
\bit
\item $\mathcal{V}\subseteq\mathcal{T}$, and
\item for all $n\in\bbN_0$, for all $t\in\mathcal{T}^n$, for all $f\in F_n$, $f(t)\in\mathcal{T}$,
\eit
the set of atomic formulas $\mathcal{C}$ is defined as
\[\mathcal{C}=\bigcup_{n\in\bbN_0}\{p(t)\mid t\in\mathcal{T}^n\land p\in P_n\},\]
and the formal language $\mathcal{L}$ of first-order logic is defined by:
\bit
\item $\mathcal{C}\subseteq\mathcal{L}$
\item $\neg P\in\mathcal{L}$ if $P\in\mathcal{L}$,
\item $(P\land Q)\in\mathcal{L}$ if $P,Q\in\mathcal{L}$,
\item $(P\lor Q)\in\mathcal{L}$ if $P,Q\in\mathcal{L}$,
\item $(P\implies Q)\in\mathcal{L}$ if $P,Q\in\mathcal{L}$, and
\item $\forall xP,\exists xP\in\mathcal{L}$ if $P\in\mathcal{L}$ and $x\in\mathcal{V}$,
\item nothing else is in $\mathcal{L}$.
\eit
Any $w\in\mathcal{L}$ is called a well-formed formula (WFF or wff) or simply formula.

A variable in a formula is either free or bounded, which are defined as follows for formulas $P$ and $Q$:
\bit
\item A variable in an atomic formula is free.
\item A variable is free in $\neg P$ if it is free in formula $P$.
\item A variable is free in $P\land Q$ if it is free in formula $P$ or $Q$.
\item A variable is free in $P\lor Q$ if it is free in formula $P$ or $Q$.
\item A variable is free in $P\implies Q$ if it is free in formula $P$ or $Q$.
\item A variable $x$ is free in $\forall yP$ and $\exists yP$ if $x$ is not the same symbol as $y$ and $x$ is free in formula $P$.
\item No other variable in a formula is free.
\eit
A formula with no free variable is called a sentence or a closed formula.

A formula $P$ with free variables $x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_n$ is denoted as $P[x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_n]$ or $P(x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_n)$.

The cardinalities of $\sigma$ and $\mathcal{L}$ are both defined as the cardinality of $\qty(\bigcup_{u\in\mathcal{P}}u)\cup\qty(\bigcup_{u\in\mathcal{F}}u)$.
\sssc{Semantics}
For a given first-order logic, its interpretation (or valuation) is defined as $\mathcal{I}=\mathcal{A},s$ with an interpretation (or valuation) structure $\mathcal{A}=(A,\sigma,I)$ of the same signature as the first-order logic with the constraint for first-order logic with equality that
\[I(=)=\{(a,a)\mid a\in A\}\]
and a variable assignment function $s$ from the variables $\mathcal{V}$ to $A$.

For any formula $P$, $\mathcal{A},s\vDash P$ denotes that $P$ is true in $\mathcal{A}$ under assignment $s$, and $\mathcal{A},s\nvDash P$, denotes that $P$ is false in $\mathcal{A}$ under assignment $s$.

For a given first-order logic with formal language $\mathcal{L}$ and interpretation $\mathcal{A},s$,
\bit
\item for any term $t$, $[t]$ or $[t]_{\mathcal{A},s}$ denotes $t$ with any function symbols $f$ replaced with $I(f)$ and any variable $x$ replaced with $s(x)$,
\item for any atomic formula $p(t_1,t_2,\ldots,t_n)$ for some predicate symbol $p\in P_n$, $\mathcal{A},s\vDash p(t)$ iff $([t_1],[t_2],\ldots,[t_n])\in I(p)$, and
\item T-schema or truth schema: with $\mathscr{I}$ mapping formula $P$ to 1 if $\mathcal{A},s\vDash P$ and to 0 if $\mathcal{A},s\nvDash P$,
\bit
\item for any $P\in\mathcal{L}$, $\mathscr{I}(\neg P)=\neg\mathscr{I}(P)$,
\item for any $P,Q\in\mathcal{L}$, $\mathscr{I}(P\land Q)=\mathscr{I}(P)\land\mathscr{I}(Q)$,
\item for any $P,Q\in\mathcal{L}$, $\mathscr{I}(P\lor Q)=\mathscr{I}(P)\lor\mathscr{I}(Q)$,
\item for any $P,Q\in\mathcal{L}$, $\mathscr{I}(P\implies Q)=\mathscr{I}(P)\implies\mathscr{I}(Q)$,
\item $\mathcal{A},s\vDash\forall xP$ iff $\forall a\in A$, replacing $x$ with $a$ makes $\mathcal{A},s\vDash P$, that is, $\forall xP=\bigwedge_{a\in A}P[x\mapsto a]$, and
\item $\mathcal{A},s\vDash\exists xP$ iff $\exists a\in A$, replacing $x$ with $a$ makes $\mathcal{A},s\vDash P$, that is, $\exists xP=\bigvee_{a\in A}P[x\mapsto a]$.
\eit
For sentences, $\mathcal{A},s$ can be denoted as $\mathcal{A}$ since there is no free variable and thus $s$ is irrelevant.
\sssc{Semantic consequence}
Given formulas $S_1,S_2,\ldots S_n,T$, $S_1,S_2,\ldots S_n\vDash T$, called that $T$ is a semantic consequence of $S_1,S_2,\ldots S_n$, means that for any interpretation $\mathcal{A},s$, if $\mathcal{A},s\vDash S_1,\mathcal{A},s\vDash S_2,\ldots,\mathcal{A},s\vDash S_n$, then $\mathcal{A},s\vDash T$.
\sssc{Equivalence of syntactic and semantic consequences}
For any formulas $S_1,S_2,\ldots S_n,T$,
\[S_1,S_2,\ldots S_n\vdash T\iff S_1,S_2,\ldots S_n\vDash T.\]
Thus syntactic and semantic consequences are called (logical) consequences.

The $\Leftarrow$ direction is the Gödel's completeness theorem and the $\Rightarrow$ direction is from the Henkin's model existence theorem.
\sssc{Classification of formulas}
A formula $P$ is called (logically) valid or a tautology, denoted as $\top$, iff for any interpretation $\mathcal{A},s$, $\mathcal{A},s\vDash P$.

A formula $P$ is called (logically) invalid or a contradiction, denoted as $\bot$, iff for any interpretation $\mathcal{A},s$, $\mathcal{A},s\nvDash P$.

A formula $P$ is called contingent iff it is neither a tautology nor a contradiction.

A formula is satisfiable iff it is not a contradiction.

If a first-order theory with signature $\sigma$ has an infinite model $\mathcal{M}$ of some cardinality $\kappa\geq\aleph_0$, then for every $\mu$ such that $\max(|\sigma|,\aleph_0)\leq\mu\leq\kappa$, it has model of cardinality $\mu$ that is an elementary substructures of $\mathcal{M}$.
\sssc{Upward Löwenheim–Skolem Theorem}
If a first-order theory with signature $\sigma$ has an infinite model $\mathcal{M}$ of some cardinality $\kappa\geq\aleph_0$, then for every $\mu\geq\kappa$, it has model of cardinality $\mu$ that is an elementary extension of $\mathcal{M}$.
\sssc{Compactness theorem}
If a first-order theory $T$ is such that all its finite subsets have models, then $T$ has model.
\ssc{Gödel's incompleteness theorems}
\sssc{Gödel's first incompleteness theorem}
Any recursively enumerable consistent deductive system that can interprets the Robinson arithmetic is syntactically incomplete.
\sssc{Gödel's second incompleteness theorem}
Any recursively enumerable consistent deductive system that can interprets the Robinson arithmetic can not prove its consistency.
\ssc{Abstract logic}
\sssc{Abstract logic}
Let $L$ be a formal language closed under logical connectives and with functionally complete set of logical connectives, and $\mathscr{M}$ be all models (possibly designated to be allowed) for it. The ordered pair $(L,\mathscr{M})$ is called an abstract logic.
\sssc{Isomorphism-invariant}
An abstract logic, $(L,\mathscr{M})$, is isomorphism-invariant iff for every two models $\mathcal{M},\mathcal{N}\in\mathscr{M}$, for every sentence $\varphi\in L$, $\varphi$ is isomorphism-invariant between $\mathcal{M}$ and $\mathcal{N}$.
\sssc{Expressive power}
All isomorphism-invariant abstract logics form a class $\mathbb{L}$ with partial order $\leq$, called weaker than or less expressive than, equivalence relation $=$, and strict partial order $<$, called strictly weaker than or strictly less expressive than, of expressive power defined, for any $(L_1,\mathscr{M}_1),(L_2,\mathscr{M}_2)\in\mathbb{L}$, with the $\mathscr{N}_1$ and $\mathscr{N}_2$ defined such that all elements of $\mathscr{N}_1\cup\mathscr{N}_2$ have the same signature $\sigma$ and domain $N$, that for any $\mathcal{M}\in\mathscr{M}_1$, there exists at least one $\mathcal{N}\in\mathscr{N}_1$ such that there exists at least one isomorphism between $\mathcal{M}$ and $\mathcal{N}$, and that for any $\mathcal{M}\in\mathscr{M}_2$, there exists at least one $\mathcal{N}\in\mathscr{N}_2$ such that there exists at least one isomorphism between $\mathcal{M}$ and $\mathcal{N}$, as:
\[(L_1,\mathscr{M}_1)\leq(L_2,\mathscr{M}_2)\iff\bigcup_{\mathcal{N}\in\mathscr{N}_1}\operatorname{Def}(\mathcal{N})\subseteq\bigcup_{\mathcal{N}\in\mathscr{N}_2}\operatorname{Def}(\mathcal{N}),\]
\[(L_1,\mathscr{M}_1)=(L_2,\mathscr{M}_2)\iff(L_1,\mathscr{M}_1)\leq(L_2,\mathscr{M}_2)\land(L_2,\mathscr{M}_2)\leq(L_1,\mathscr{M}_1).\]
\[(L_1,\mathscr{M}_1)<(L_2,\mathscr{M}_2)\iff(L_1,\mathscr{M}_1)\leq(L_2,\mathscr{M}_2)\land\neg(L_2,\mathscr{M}_2)\leq(L_1,\mathscr{M}_1).\]
\sssc{Compactness property}
For an abstract logic $(L,\mathscr{M})$, if for every theory $T$ over its language, that all its finite subsets have model in $\mathscr{M}$ implies that $T$ has model in $\mathscr{M}$, then the abstract logic has compactness property.

Compactness property implies that for any theory has model in $\mathscr{M}$, there exists a sound finitary deductive system that derive it.

That for any theory of a model in $\mathscr{M}$, there exists a sound, finitary and semantically complete deductive system that derive it, implies compactness property.
\sssc{Downward Löwenheim–Skolem property}
For an abstract logic $(L,\mathscr{M})$ with signature $\sigma$, if for every theory $T$ over $L$ that has an infinite model $\mathcal{M}\in\mathscr{M}$ of some cardinality $\kappa\geq\aleph_0$, for every $\mu$ such that $\max(|\sigma|,\aleph_0)\leq\mu\leq\kappa$, it has model of cardinality $\mu$ that is an elementary substructures of $\mathcal{M}\in\mathscr{M}$, then the abstract logic is called to have downward Löwenheim–Skolem property.
\sssc{Upward Löwenheim–Skolem Theorem}
For an abstract logic $(L,\mathscr{M})$ , if for every theory $T$ over $L$ that has an infinite model $\mathcal{M}\in\mathscr{M}$ of some cardinality $\kappa\geq\aleph_0$, then for every $\mu\geq\kappa$, it has model of cardinality $\mu$ that is an elementary extension of $\mathcal{M}\in\mathscr{M}$.
\sssc{Lindström's theorem}
Any isomorphism-invariant abstract logic extending first-order logic with standard semantics that has compact property and downward Löwenheim–Skolem property must not has strictly more expressive power than first-order logic with standard semantics.
