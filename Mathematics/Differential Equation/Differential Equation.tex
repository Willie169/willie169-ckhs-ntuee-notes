\sct{Introduction}
\ssc{Definition}
An equation containing the derivatives of one or more unknown functions (or
dependent variables), with respect to one or more independent variables, is
said to be a differential equation (DE).
\ssc{Classification by type}
If a differential equation contains only ordinary
derivatives of one or more unknown functions with respect to a single independent
variable, it is said to be an ordinary differential equation (ODE). An equation
involving partial derivatives of one or more unknown functions of two or more inde-
pendent variables is called a partial differential equation (PDE).
\ssc{Classification by order}
The order of a differential equation is the order of the highest derivative in the equation.
