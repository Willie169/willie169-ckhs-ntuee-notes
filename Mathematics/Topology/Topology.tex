\section{Topology (拓樸學)}
\subsection{Topological space (拓樸空間)}
A topological space consists of a set $X$ and a topology $\mathcal{T}$ on it, denoted as \( (X, \mathcal{T}) \). Where the set \( X \) is the set of points in the space, and the topology \( \mathcal{T} \) is the set of subsets of \( X \) that satisfies:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \(\varnothing,X\in\mathcal{T} \)
\item Closed under arbitrary unions: \(\forall\mathcal{S}\subseteq\mathcal{T}:\,\bigcup_{A\in\mathcal{S}}A\in\mathcal{T}\)
\item Closed under finite intersection: \(\forall\mathcal{S}\subseteq\mathcal{T}\text{ s.t. }\abs{\mathcal{S}}<\infty:\,\bigcap_{A\in\mathcal{S}}A\in\mathcal{T}\)
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Homomorphism (同胚)}
Topological spaces $(X,\mathcal{T}_X)$ and $(Y,\mathcal{T}_Y)$ are called homeomorphic if there exists a mapping $f:\,X\to Y$ between them such that $f$ is bijective and continuous and $f^{-1}$ is continuous, written as \( X \cong Y \), and $f$ is called a homomorphism between them.
\subsection{Open set (開集)}
In a topological space \( (X, \mathcal{T}) \), an open subset \( O \subseteq X \) is defined to be
\[O\in \mathcal{T}.\]
\subsection{Open neighborhood (開鄰域)}
An open neighborhood of a point $P$ in a topological space $X$ is any open subset $O\subseteq X$ such that $P\in O$.

An open neighborhood of a subset $V$ in a topological space $X$ is any open subset $O\subseteq X$ such that $V\subseteq O$.
\ssc{Interior (內部) of subset}
The interior of a subset $S$ of a topological space $X$, denoted by $\operatorname{int}_XS$, $\operatorname{int}S$, $\operatorname{int}_X(S)$, $\operatorname{int}(S)$, or $S^{\circ}$, is defined as
\[\operatorname{int}(S) = \{ x \in S \mid \exists \text{\ open\ } U\subeteq X \text{\ s.t.\ } x \in U \subseteq S \}.\]
\subsection{Neighborhood (鄰域)}
A subset $U$ is a neighborhood of a point $P$ if and only if there exists an open set $O$ such that $P\in O\subseteq U$.

A subset $U$ is a neighborhood of a subset $V$ if and only if $V\subseteq\operatorname{int}(U)$.
\ssc{Subspace topology}
The subspace topology of a topological space $(X,\mathcal{T})$ in a subset $I$ of $X$ is defined as the set 
\[\mathcal{I}=\{U\cap I | U\in\mathcal{T}\}.\]
\subsection{Limit point (極限點), cluster point, or accumulation point (集積點)}
Let $S$ be a subset of a topological space $X$. A point $x$ in $X$ is a limit point, cluster point, or accumulation point of the set $S$ if every neighborhood of $x$ contains at least one point of $S$ different from $x$ itself.
\subsection{Closure (閉包)}
The closure of a subset $S$ of points in a topological space consists of all points in $S$ together with all limit points of $S$.
\subsection{Closed set (閉集)}
A subset $A$ of a topological space $(X,\mathcal{T})$ is called closed if its complement $X\setminus A\in\mathcal{T}$.
\subsection{Borel set (博雷爾集)}
A Borel set $B$ is any set in a topological space $(X,\mathcal{T})$ that can be formed from open sets through the operations of countable union, countable intersection, and relative complement, that is:
\[\begin{aligned}
B\in &\{\bigcup_{O\in\mathcal{S}}O:\,\mathcal{S}\subseteq\mathcal{T},\abs{\mathcal{S}}<\infty\}\\
& \cup \{\bigcap_{O\in\mathcal{S}}O:\,\mathcal{S}\subseteq\mathcal{T},\abs{\mathcal{S}}<\infty\}\\
& \cup \{O\setminus P:\,O,P\in\mathcal{T}\}
\end{aligned}\]
\subsection{Filter}
A filter on a set $X$ is a family $\mathcal{B}$ of subsets of $X$ such that: 
\begin{enumerate}
\item $X\in\mathcal{B}$.
\item $\varnothing\in\mathcal{B}$.
\item $A\in\mathcal{B}\land B\in\mathcal{B}\implies A\cap B\in\mathcal{B}$.
\item $A\subseteq B\subseteq X\land A\in\mathcal{A}\in\mathcal{B}\implies B\in\mathcal{B}$.
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Base or basis (基)}
Given a topological space $(X,\mathcal{T})$, a base (or basis) for the topology $\mathcal{T}$ (also called a base for $X$ if the topology is understood) is a family $\mathcal{B}\subseteq\mathcal{T}$ of open sets such that every open set of the topology can be represented as the union of some subfamily of $\mathcal{B}$.

The topology generated by a base $\mathcal{B}$, generally denoted by $\tau(\mathcal{B})$ can be defined to be follows: A subset $O\subseteq X$ is to be declared as open, if for all $x\in O$, there exists some $B\in\mathcal{B}$ such that $x\in B\subseteq O$.
\subsection{Prefilter or filter base}
$\mathcal{B}$ is called a prefilter if its upward closure $\uparrow\mathcal{B}$ is a filter.
\ssc{Quotient space (商空間)}
Let $X$ be a topological space and $\cong$ be an equivalence relation on it. The quotient space $Y$ of $X$ under $\cong$ is the quotient set of $X$ under $\cong$ equipped with the quotient topology, defined as $U\subseteq Y$ is open in the quotient topology on $Y$ if and only if $\{x\in X\mid[x]\in U\}$ is open in $X$ and $V\subseteq Y$ is closed in the quotient topology on $Y$ if and only if $\{x\in X\mid[x]\in V\}$ is closed in $X$.

A topological space is called a Hausdorff space, separated space, or T$_2$ space if and only if any two distinct points in it are separated by neighborhoods. This condition is called the T$_2$ condition or the third separation theorem. A topological space is a $T_2$ space implies it is a $T_1$ space.
\sssc{Urysohn space or T\(_{2\text{\textonehalf}}\) space}
Points $x$ and $y$ in a topological space are separated by closed neighborhoods if and only if there exists a closed neighborhood $U$ of $x$ and a closed neighborhood $V$ of $y$ such that $U$ and $V$ are disjointed.

A topological space is called a Urysohn space or T\(_{2\text{\textonehalf}}\) space if and only if any two distinct points in it are separated by closed neighborhoods. A topological space is a T\(_{2\text{\textonehalf}}\) space implies it is a $T_2$ space.

Points $x$ and $y$ in a topological space $X$ are separated by a (continuous) function if and only if there exists a continuous function $f\colon X\to [0,1]$ such that $f(x)=0$ and $f(y)=1$.

A topological space is called a completely Hausdorff space, functionally Hausdorff space, or completely T$_2$ space if and only if any two distinct points in it are separated by a continuous function. A topological space is a completely T$_2$ space implies it is a T\(_{2\text{\textonehalf}}\) space.

A topological space is a completely T$_3$ space implies it is a completely T$_2$ space.
\sssc{Normal space (正規空間)}
Disjoint closed sets $E$ and $F$ in a topological space are separated by neighborhoods if and only if there exists a neighborhood $U$ of $E$ and a neighborhood $V$ of $F$ such that $U$ and $V$ are disjointed.

A topological space is called a normal space if and only if any two distinct closed sets in it are separated by neighborhoods. A topological space is a normal space implies it is a regular space.
\sssc{Urysohn's lemma}
Two closed sets $E$ and $F$ in a topological space $X$ are separated by a (continuous) function if and only if there exists a continuous function $f\colon X\to [0,1]$ such that $\subseteq f^{-1}(\{0\})$ and $F\subseteq f^{-1}(\{1\})$.

The Urysohn's lemma states that, a topological space is a normal space if and only if any two disjoint closed sets in it are separated by a (continuous) function.
\sssc{Normal Hausdorff space or T$_4$ space}

A topological space is a completely normal Hausdorff space implies it is a normal Hausdorff space and a completely regular Hausdorff space.
\sssc{Perfectly normal space}
Two closed sets $E$ and $F$ in a topological space $X$ are precisely separated by a (continuous) function if and only if there exists a continuous function $f\colon X\to [0,1]$ such that $E=f^{-1}(\{0\})$ and $F=f^{-1}(\{1\})$.

\sssc{Connected space (連通空間)}
A topological space is called disconnected if and only if it can be expressed as the union of two disjoint non-empty open sets; otherwise, it is called connected.
\sssc{Path-connected space (路徑連通空間)}
A topological space $X$ is called path-connected if and only if for any two points $x,y\in X$, there existes a continuous function $f\colon[0,1]\to X$ such that $f(0)=x$ and $f(1)=y$. A topological space is path-connected implies it is connected.
\sssc{Simply connected space or 1-connected space (單連通空間)}

\sssc{Compact space (緊緻空間)}
A topological space $X$ is called compact if and only if for every collection $C$ of open subsets of $X$ such that
\[X=\bigcup_{S\in C}S,\]
there is a finite subcollection $F\subseteq C$ such that
\[X=\bigcup _{S\in F}S.\]

\[K\subseteq\bigcup_{S\in C}S,\]
there is a finite subcollection $F\subseteq C$ such that
\[K\subseteq\bigcup _{S\in F}S.\]
\subsection{Locally finite cover}
Let $X$ be a topological space, and $\{U_i\mid i\in I\}$ be a cover of $X$. We say that $U$ is locally finite if for all $x\in X$, there exists $V\ni x$ that is open in $X$ such that the set $\{i\in I\mid V\cap U_i\neq\varnothing\}$ is finite.
\ssc{Dense (稠密) subset}

\subsection{Metric space (度量空間 or 賦距空間)}
\sssc{Metric space}
Metric space is an ordered pair $(M, d)$ where $M$ is a set and $d$ is a metric on M, i.e., a function $d:\,M\times M\to\mathbb{R}$ satisfying the following axioms for all points $x,y,z\in M$:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The distance from a point to itself is zero: $d(x,x)=0$.
\item (Positivity) The distance between two distinct points is always positive:$x\neq y\implies d(x,y)>0$.
\item (Symmetry) The distance from $x$ to $y$ is always the same as the distance from $y$ to $x$: $d(x,y)=d(y,x)$.
\item The triangle inequality: $d(x,z)\leq d(x,y)+d(y,z)$.
\end{enumerate}

For a normed space $(X,\|\cdot\|)$, unless otherwise specified, it is equipped with a metric $d$ defined as
\[d(x,y)=\|x-y\|,\quad \forall x,y\in X.\]
\sssc{Cauchy sequence (柯西序列)}
Given a metric space $(x,d)$, a sequence of elements of $X$:
\[x_1,x_2,x_3,\ldots\]
is Cauchy if for every positive real number $\varepsilon$ there is a positive integer $N$ such that for all positive integers $m,n>N$:
\[d\left(x_m,x_n\right)<\varepsilon.\]
\sssc{Complete metric space (完備度量空間) or Cauchy space (柯西空間)}
A metric space $(x,d)$ is complete if every Cauchy sequence of points in $X$ has a limit that is also in $X$.
\subsection{Open ball (開球)}

\[B(a)_{<r}:=\left\{p\in X:\, d(a,p)<r\right\}.\]
\subsection{Closed ball (閉球)}

\subsection{Topological field (拓樸域)}
A topological field is a topological space, such that addition, multiplication, the maps $a\mapsto -a$, and $a\mapsto a^{-1}$ are continuous maps with respect to the topology of the space.
\ssc{Net (網)}
\sssc{Net (網)}
A net in $X$, denoted as $x_{\bullet }=\left(x_{a}\right)_{a\in A}$ or $\left\langle x_{a}\right\rangle _{a\in A}$, is a function of the form $x_{\bullet }\colon A\to X$ whose domain $A$ is some directed set, and whose values are $x_{\bullet }(a)=x_{a}$ in a topological space $X$. Elements of a net's domain are called its indices.
\sssc{Eventually or residually}
A net $x_{\bullet }=\left(x_{a}\right)_{a\in A}$ in $X$ is said to be eventually or residually in a set $S$ if there exists some $a\in A$ such that for every $b\in A$ with $b\geq a$, the point $x_b\in S$.
\sssc{Limit of nets}
A point $x$ in a topological space $X$ is called a limit point or limit of a net $x_{\bullet }$ in $X$ if, for every open neighborhood $U$ of $x$, the net $x_{\bullet }$ is eventually in $U$, also called that the net converges to/towards $x$, and denoted as $x_{\bullet}\to x$, $x_a\to x$, $\lim x_{\bullet}\to x$, $\lim_{a\in A}x_a\to x$, or $\lim_ax_a\to x$.

If $\lim x_{\bullet}\to x$ and this limit is unique (i.e. $\lim x_{\bullet}\to y$ only if $x=y$), then one writes $\lim x_{\bullet}=x$, $\lim_{a\in A}x_a=x$, or $\lim_ax_a=x$.
\sssc{Cofinally (共尾地) or frequently}
A net $x_{\bullet }=\left(x_{a}\right)_{a\in A}$ in $X$ is said to be cofinally or frequently in a set $S$ if for every $a\in A$ there exists $b\in A$ such that $b\geq a\land x_b\in S$.
\sssc{Cluster point, or accumulation point (集積點)}
A point $x$ in a topological space $X$ is called a cluster point or accumulation point of a net $x_{\bullet }$ in $X$ if, for every open neighborhood $U$ of $x$, the net $x_{\bullet }$ is cofinally in $U$, also called that the net clusters to/towards $x$.

A limit point of a net is necessary a cluster point of it.
\sssc{Subnet or Willard-subnet}
A net $s_{\bullet }=\left(s_{i}\right)_{i\in I}$ is called a subnet or 
{\displaystyle s_{\bullet }} is called a subnet or Willard-subnet of another net $x_{\bullet }=\left(x_{a}\right)_{a\in A}$ if there exists an order-preserving map $h\colon I\to A$ such that $h(I)$ is a cofinal subset of $A$ and 
\[s_{i}=x_{h(i)}\quad \forall i\in I.\]
\sssc{Ultranet or universal net}
A net $x_{\bullet }$ in $X$ is called an ultranet or a universal net if for every subset $S\subseteq X$, $x_{\bullet }$ is eventually in $S$ or $X\setminus S$.

A point is a limit point of a ultranet if and only if it a cluster point of it.
\sssc{In Hausdorff spaces}
A net in a Hausdorff space has at most one limit; if it has one, the limit point of it is the only cluster point of it.
